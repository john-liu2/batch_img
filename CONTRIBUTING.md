a _pull request_ with your fix. __No issue is assigned in this repo__. Please
__do not__ ask for permission to work on an issue.

Please add `Fixes #{$ISSUE_NUMBER}` to the pull request description that resolves
the open issue.

### One-time Development Setup

The project was developed on **macOS** using **PyCharm** IDE. The commands below
should be run in **Terminal** window on **macOS**.

#### One-time `uv` Setup

Install the [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) tool one-time to prepare for
**all** Python tools and packages installation. Install
[`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) by its standalone installers:

```
# On macOS and Linux.
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

After `git clone ...` the repo to your local disk, go to the local project folder
and run the [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) command:

```
uv pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

This will create a hidden virtualenv dir in the local project folder - `.venv` and
install all dependencies defined in the `pyproject.toml` file in this virtualenv.

If the `.venv` exists, this command will update the project version and dependencies
in the existing `.venv` virtualenv.

#### Activate Development Virtualenv

Run the command to activate the development virtualenv:

```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### Activate `pre-commit`

The [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/#installation) tool is installed as part
of **dev** dependencies. This tool will automatically trigger actions when making
a `git commit ...`. To activate the tool, please run the _one-time_ command:

```
pre-commit install
```

After the activation, the tool will run every time you commit a change. If any
error during the run, the `git commit ...` will fail. Please fix the error and
commit the change again. _Optionally,_ you can manually run the tool:

```
pre-commit run --all-files --show-diff-on-failure
```

#### Run `ruff`

The [`ruff`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) tool is installed as part of
**dev** dependencies. It is to check and fix Python code format and lint.
Run the [`ruff`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) linter command:

```
ruff check --fix --exit-non-zero-on-fix
```

Run the [`ruff`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) formater command:

```
ruff format --diff --check
```

#### Run `pylint`

The [`pylint`](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint) tool is installed as part
of **dev** dependencies. It is a static code analyser checking the Python code
without running it. The `pylint` is slower than `ruff`. They are complementary
to each other.
Run the [`pylint`](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint) command:

```
pylint $(git ls-files '*.py')
```

#### Run `pytest`

The [`pytest`](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest) tool is installed as part of
**dev** dependencies. It will run all the **unit tests** and integration tests.

* Run test on one single test in a test file, e.g. `test_auto.py`:

```
pytest -sv tests/test_auto.py -k test_process_an_image
```

* Run test on a test file, e.g. `test_auto.py`:

```
pytest -sv tests/test_auto.py
```

* Run test on all test files:

```
pytest
```

* Run test on all test files with code coverage:

```
pytest --cov-report=term --cov=batch_img tests
```

* Run __test__ command defined
  in [`Makefile`](https://github.com/john-liu2/batch_img/blob/main/Makefile):

```
make test
```
